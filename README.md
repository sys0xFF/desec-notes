# Desec Notes

**desec-notes** is my personal path through the complete DESEC Security offensive pentesting course.  
It's a 12-week structured experience into the world of Linux, networking, exploits, scripting, recon, and real-world red team ops.

Each module I study is documented here — with insights, commands, reflections, and tools tested along the way.  
This is my digital war journal.
