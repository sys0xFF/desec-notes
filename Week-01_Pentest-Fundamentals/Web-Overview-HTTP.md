# Web and HTTP Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how the HTTP protocol works, the interaction between clients and web servers, and how tools like Apache and Burp Suite play a role in penetration testing and web security.

## 1. Understanding HTTP Requests and Responses

The HTTP protocol is based on **requests** and **responses**.

**Example Flow:**

```
Client ---> HTTP Request: GET / HTTP/1.1 ---> Web Server  
Client <--- HTTP Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK <--- Web Server
```

---

## 2. HTTP Structure

An HTTP message is typically composed of:
- **Header**
- **Body**

### Common HTTP Methods

| Method  | Description                               |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| GET     | Retrieves data from the server            |
| POST    | Sends data to the server (e.g. forms)     |
| HEAD    | Similar to GET but only retrieves headers |
| PUT     | Uploads a representation of the resource  |
| DELETE  | Removes the specified resource            |
| OPTIONS | Describes the communication options       |

---

## 3. HTTP Status Codes

HTTP responses return status codes to indicate the result of the request.

| Status Code | Description                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 200 OK      | Request succeeded                   |
| 301 Moved Permanently | Resource has been moved  |
| 403 Forbidden | Access is not allowed             |
| 404 Not Found | Resource not found                |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Server-side failure   |

## 4. Server-Side Basics with Apache

Start the Apache server:

```bash
service apache2 start
```

Check running services:

```bash
netstat -nlpt
```

Apache default directory:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
ls
```

Rename the index file:

```bash
mv index.html original.html
```

This causes directory listing (Index of /) to appear if no index file is present â€” a misconfiguration known as **Directory Browsing**.

Create a folder and file:

```bash
mkdir admin
touch admin/test.txt
```

Accessing `/admin` will show directory contents if misconfigured.

Edit Apache configuration:

```bash
nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

Modify this section to disable indexing:

```apache
<Directory /var/www/>
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

Now accessing directories without index files will result in `403 Forbidden`.

To hide server version info:

```bash
nano /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf
```

Change:

```
ServerTokens Prod
ServerSignature Off
```

## 5. Apache Log Analysis

Apache access logs can be tailed to observe client activity:

```bash
cd /var/log/apache2/
tail -f access.log
```

These logs show client IP, timestamp, user agent, requested resource, and more.

## 6. Client-Side Basics

When accessing a site like:

```
https://businesscorp.com.br
```

You can inspect source code via "View Page Source".

Test directory traversal:

```
https://businesscorp.com.br/admin
```

Use netcat to manually send HTTP requests:

```bash
nc -v www.businesscorp.com.br 80
```

### Example: Valid Request

```
GET / HTTP/1.0
```

### Example: Invalid Request

```
GET /nonexistent HTTP/1.0
```

Returns a `404 Not Found`.

### HEAD Request Example

```
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```

Returns headers only, including server info.

### OPTIONS Request Example

```
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.0
```

Returns allowed methods:

```
Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS
```

## 7. Burp Suite Overview

**Burp Suite** is a powerful web security tool that acts as a **proxy** to intercept and analyze HTTP/S traffic between the client (browser) and server.

### Key Features:

- **Proxy**: Intercept requests and responses in real-time.
- **Repeater**: Modify and resend requests for analysis.
- **Intruder**: Automate attacks like fuzzing or brute-force.
- **Scanner (Pro)**: Automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Decoder**: Encode/decode strings (e.g., base64, URL encoding).
- **Comparer**: Compare HTTP messages.

### Example Use Cases:

- Capture a login request, modify parameters in Repeater.
- Test for SQL injection by injecting payloads via Intruder.
- Analyze cookies and headers to identify insecure configurations.
- Check server responses for version disclosure or verbose errors.

Burp Suite is essential in web application pentesting and complements manual HTTP inspection for deeper vulnerability discovery.
