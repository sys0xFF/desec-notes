## 1 – Script for Direct DNS Research

When Zone Transfer techniques unfortunately don't work, one alternative to obtain subdomain data is **DNS Brute Force**.

### Understanding DNS Response Patterns

First, we need to understand the standard patterns when DNS queries succeed or fail.

**Successful Query:**
```bash
host rh.businesscorp.com.br
```
```
rh.businesscorp.com.br has address 37.59.174.229
```

**Failed Query (Error Pattern):**
```bash
host qualquercoisa.businesscorp.com.br
```
```
Host qualquercoisa.businesscorp.com.br not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
```

### Creating a Subdomain Wordlist

Create a file with common subdomain names:

```bash
nano lista.txt
```

**Example Subdomains:**
```
firewall
monitoramento
intranet
ns1
ns01
mail
webmail
rh
sistema
homologacao
admin
logs
devs
documentos
server
api
www
ftp
portal
vpn
secure
test
staging
dev
prod
database
db
backup
git
jenkins
confluence
jira
nagios
zabbix
grafana
splunk
elk
kibana
prometheus
```

### DNS Brute Force Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# DNS Brute Force Script
# Usage: ./dns_bruteforce.sh domain.com

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <domain>"
    echo "Example: $0 businesscorp.com.br"
    exit 1
fi

DOMAIN="$1"
WORDLIST="lista.txt"

if [ ! -f "$WORDLIST" ]; then
    echo "[-] Wordlist file '$WORDLIST' not found!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "[+] Starting DNS brute force for: $DOMAIN"
echo "[+] Using wordlist: $WORDLIST"
echo "[+] Found subdomains:"
echo "================================"

for palavra in $(cat $WORDLIST); do
    result=$(host $palavra.$DOMAIN 2>/dev/null | grep -v "NXDOMAIN")
    if [ ! -z "$result" ]; then
        echo "$result"
    fi
done

echo "================================"
echo "[+] DNS brute force complete"
```

### Usage:

```bash
chmod +x dns_bruteforce.sh
./dns_bruteforce.sh businesscorp.com.br
```

---

## 2 – Script for Reverse DNS Research

Another technique we can use is **Reverse DNS Research**. In the previous section we used Direct DNS Research, and now we'll see how to perform Reverse DNS Research. This is valuable because reverse DNS lookups (searching by IP to resolve PTR records) can often reveal subdomains that wouldn't be found through other methods.

### Understanding the Process

Using our previous brute force script, it returns:

```bash
./dns_bruteforce.sh businesscorp.com.br
```

**Example Output:**
```
intranet.businesscorp.com.br has address 37.59.174.228
ns1.businesscorp.com.br has address 37.59.174.225
mail.businesscorp.com.br has address 37.59.174.227
rh.businesscorp.com.br has address 37.59.174.229
```

### Discovering the Network Block

Next, we perform a WHOIS query on one of these IPs to discover the network block:

```bash
whois 37.59.174.225
```

**Key Information:**
```
inetnum: 37.59.174.224 - 37.59.174.239
```

### Reverse DNS Scanning Script

Now we can create a script to scan this network block and find additional subdomains:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Reverse DNS Scanner Script
# Usage: ./reverse_dns.sh <base_ip> <start_range> <end_range>

if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <base_ip> <start_range> <end_range>"
    echo "Example: $0 37.59.174 224 239"
    exit 1
fi

BASE_IP="$1"
START_RANGE="$2"
END_RANGE="$3"

echo "[+] Starting reverse DNS scan for: $BASE_IP.$START_RANGE-$END_RANGE"
echo "[+] Found PTR records:"
echo "================================"

for ip in $(seq $START_RANGE $END_RANGE); do
    full_ip="$BASE_IP.$ip"
    result=$(host $full_ip 2>/dev/null | grep "domain name pointer" | awk '{print $5}')
    
    if [ ! -z "$result" ]; then
        echo "$full_ip -> $result"
    fi
done

echo "================================"
echo "[+] Reverse DNS scan complete"
```

### Enhanced Reverse DNS Script

Here's an improved version that combines both approaches:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Advanced Reverse DNS Discovery Script
# Usage: ./advanced_reverse_dns.sh <domain>

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <domain>"
    echo "Example: $0 businesscorp.com.br"
    exit 1
fi

DOMAIN="$1"
TEMP_FILE="/tmp/discovered_ips_$$"

echo "[+] Advanced Reverse DNS Discovery for: $DOMAIN"
echo "================================"

# Step 1: Discover some IPs from the domain
echo "[+] Step 1: Discovering initial IP addresses..."
host $DOMAIN 2>/dev/null | grep "has address" | awk '{print $4}' > $TEMP_FILE

# Also try common subdomains
for sub in www mail ns1 ns2 ftp; do
    host $sub.$DOMAIN 2>/dev/null | grep "has address" | awk '{print $4}' >> $TEMP_FILE
done

# Remove duplicates
sort -u $TEMP_FILE > ${TEMP_FILE}.unique
mv ${TEMP_FILE}.unique $TEMP_FILE

if [ ! -s $TEMP_FILE ]; then
    echo "[-] No IP addresses found for $DOMAIN"
    rm -f $TEMP_FILE
    exit 1
fi

echo "[+] Found initial IPs:"
cat $TEMP_FILE

# Step 2: Get network blocks for discovered IPs
echo ""
echo "[+] Step 2: Discovering network blocks..."
for ip in $(cat $TEMP_FILE); do
    echo "[+] Checking network block for: $ip"
    netblock=$(whois $ip 2>/dev/null | grep -E "inetnum:|NetRange:" | head -1)
    if [ ! -z "$netblock" ]; then
        echo "    $netblock"
    fi
done

echo ""
echo "[+] Step 3: Performing reverse DNS scan..."
# Extract base IP and range from first IP for demonstration
first_ip=$(head -1 $TEMP_FILE)
base_ip=$(echo $first_ip | cut -d. -f1-3)

# Simple range scan around discovered IPs
echo "[+] Scanning network range around discovered IPs..."
for ip in $(cat $TEMP_FILE); do
    last_octet=$(echo $ip | cut -d. -f4)
    start_range=$((last_octet - 5))
    end_range=$((last_octet + 5))
    
    # Ensure range is within valid bounds
    if [ $start_range -lt 1 ]; then start_range=1; fi
    if [ $end_range -gt 254 ]; then end_range=254; fi
    
    echo "[+] Scanning range: $base_ip.$start_range-$end_range"
    for scan_ip in $(seq $start_range $end_range); do
        full_ip="$base_ip.$scan_ip"
        result=$(host $full_ip 2>/dev/null | grep "domain name pointer" | awk '{print $5}')
        
        if [ ! -z "$result" ]; then
            echo "    $full_ip -> $result"
        fi
    done
    break  # Only scan around first IP to avoid too much output
done

echo ""

# Cleanup
rm -f $TEMP_FILE

echo "================================"
echo "[+] Discovery complete"
```

### Why Reverse DNS is Valuable

This technique serves as an alternative to other DNS reconnaissance methods because:

1. **Hidden Subdomains:** May reveal subdomains not found through brute force
2. **Infrastructure Mapping:** Shows the actual network layout
3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Scans entire network blocks systematically
4. **PTR Record Discovery:** Finds reverse DNS entries that might be missed

### Practical Application

By taking any IP from the target host, you can:
1. Extract the netblock using WHOIS
2. Scan the entire netblock range
3. Discover subdomains that wouldn't be found through brute force or other alternative methods

### Usage Examples:

**Basic Reverse DNS:**
```bash
./reverse_dns.sh 37.59.174 224 239
```

**Advanced Discovery:**
```bash
./advanced_reverse_dns.sh businesscorp.com.br
```

This comprehensive approach to DNS reconnaissance ensures maximum subdomain discovery by combining both direct brute force and reverse DNS techniques.

## 3 – SPF Analysis

### What is SPF?

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** is an email authentication method designed to identify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain.

### SPF Configuration Examples

**No SPF Record:**
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to email spoofing (Mail Spoofing)
- **Impact:** Anyone can forge emails from your domain

**Soft Fail Configuration:**
```
v=spf1 include:allowedserver.com ?all
```
- **Status:** Susceptible (neutral policy)
- **Behavior:** Recipients may accept forged emails

**Soft Fail with Warning:**
```
v=spf1 include:allowedserver.com ~all
```
- **Status:** Susceptible (treated as suspicious)
- **Behavior:** Emails marked as suspicious but may still be delivered

**Hard Fail (Recommended):**
```
v=spf1 include:allowedserver.com -all
```
- **Status:** Secure configuration
- **Behavior:** Unauthorized emails are rejected

### Testing SPF Records

To check if a domain is vulnerable to email spoofing:

```bash
host -t txt "domain"
```

**Example:**
```bash
host -t txt businesscorp.com.br
```

### Exploiting Weak SPF

For domains with weak or missing SPF records, you can test email spoofing using:
- **Tool:** https://emkei.cz/
- **Purpose:** Send emails appearing to come from vulnerable domains
- **Use Case:** Social engineering and phishing assessments

## 4 – Understanding Subdomain Takeover

### What is Subdomain Takeover?

**Subdomain Takeover** is a vulnerability that occurs when a subdomain points to a service that has been decommissioned or is no longer controlled by the domain owner. An attacker can register the abandoned service and gain control over the subdomain.

### How It Works

**Legitimate Configuration:**
```
Business Corp          →    GITHUB         →    ACTIVE
doc.businesscorp.com.br --- CNAME --> businesscorp.github.io
```

**Normal CNAME Setup:**
```
Business Corp          →    EXTERNAL       →    ACTIVE
site.businesscorp.com.br --- CNAME --> grandbusinesscorp.com.br
```

**Vulnerable Configuration:**
```
Business Corp          →    AMAZON S3      →    DEACTIVATED
dev.businesscorp.com.br --- CNAME --> businesscorp.s3.amazon.com
```

### The Attack Vector

**Problem Scenario:**
1. **Original Setup:** `dev.businesscorp.com.br` points to `businesscorp.s3.amazon.com`
2. **Service Abandoned:** Company stops using the S3 bucket but leaves DNS record
3. **Attacker Action:** Criminal registers the abandoned `businesscorp` bucket on Amazon S3
4. **Result:** Attacker gains control over the subdomain content

### Vulnerability Conditions

**Root Cause:**
- DNS record pointing to a deactivated service
- The external service address becomes available for registration

**Detection Method:**
```bash
host -t cname doc.businesscorp.com.br
```

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
1. **Is the resolved address active?**
   - **YES** → Not vulnerable
   - **NO** → Check if registration is possible
2. **Can the service be registered?**
   - **YES** → **VULNERABLE**
   - **NO** → Not vulnerable

## 5 – Creating a Subdomain Takeover Script

### Basic Detection Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

    echo "Usage: $0 <domain>"
    echo "Example: $0 businesscorp.com.br"
    exit 1
fi

DOMAIN="$1"
WORDLIST="lista.txt"

if [ ! -f "$WORDLIST" ]; then
    echo "[-] Wordlist file '$WORDLIST' not found!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "[+] Scanning for potential subdomain takeovers: $DOMAIN"
echo "[+] Checking CNAME records..."
echo "================================"

for palavra in $(cat $WORDLIST); do
    result=$(host -t cname $palavra.$DOMAIN 2>/dev/null | grep "alias for")
    if [ ! -z "$result" ]; then
        echo "[+] Found CNAME: $result"
        
        # Extract the target from the CNAME
        target=$(echo "$result" | awk '{print $6}' | sed 's/\.$//')
        echo "    [*] Target: $target"
        
        # Test if target is reachable
        ping_result=$(ping -c 1 -W 2 "$target" 2>/dev/null)
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "    [*] Status: ACTIVE (Not vulnerable)"
        else
            echo "    [!] Status: UNREACHABLE (Potential takeover target)"
        fi
        echo ""
    fi
done

echo "================================"
echo "[+] Subdomain takeover scan complete"
echo "[!] Manually verify any unreachable targets for registration availability"
```

## 6 – Taking Control of Subdomains

### Attack Scenario Example

**Discovery Phase:**
1. **DNS Brute Force:** Find `dev.businesscorp.com.br`
2. **CNAME Check:** `dev.businesscorp.com.br` points to `devbusinesscorp.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com`

### Vulnerability Assessment Process

**Step 1: Check Service Status**
```bash
curl -I http://devbusinesscorp.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

**Step 2: Determine Vulnerability**
- **Service Active:** Not vulnerable
- **Service Inactive:** Check registration availability

**Step 3: Registration Test**
- **Can Register:** **VULNERABLE** to takeover
- **Cannot Register:** Not vulnerable

### Common Vulnerable Services

| Service | Indicator | Registration Method |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **GitHub Pages** | `*.github.io` | Create GitHub repository |
| **Amazon S3** | `*.amazonaws.com` | Register S3 bucket |
| **Heroku** | `*.herokuapp.com` | Create Heroku app |
| **Azure** | `*.azurewebsites.net` | Create Azure app |
| **Netlify** | `*.netlify.com` | Deploy to Netlify |

### Exploitation Steps

1. **Identify** vulnerable CNAME pointing to inactive service
2. **Register** the service using the same name
3. **Deploy** content to the registered service
4. **Verify** control over the original subdomain

## 9 – Digital Certificate Collection

### Certificate Transparency for Subdomain Discovery

**Certificate Transparency (CT)** logs provide an excellent source for discovering subdomains, as SSL/TLS certificates must include all domain names they protect, including subdomains.

### Why Certificate Transparency is Valuable

When organizations obtain SSL/TLS certificates for their domains and subdomains, these certificates are logged in public Certificate Transparency logs. This creates a comprehensive record of:

- **Main Domains:** Primary website certificates
- **Subdomains:** All protected subdomains
- **Wildcard Certificates:** Certificates covering multiple subdomains
- **Historical Data:** Previous certificates and their coverage

### Google Transparency Report

**URL:** transparencyreport.google.com

**Features:**
- **Certificate Search:** Find certificates by domain
- **Subdomain Discovery:** View all domains in certificates
- **Certificate Details:** Issuer, validity period, and technical information
- **Historical View:** Previous certificates and changes over time

**Usage:**
1. Navigate to Certificate Transparency section
2. Search for target domain (e.g., "businesscorp.com.br")
3. Review all certificates containing the domain
4. Extract subdomains from certificate Subject Alternative Names (SAN)

### crt.sh

**URL:** crt.sh

**Advanced Features:**
- **SQL-like Interface:** Powerful search capabilities
- **API Access:** Programmatic certificate data retrieval
- **Real-time Updates:** Latest certificate submissions
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Multiple CT log sources

**Search Examples:**
```
# Basic domain search
businesscorp.com.br

# Wildcard subdomain search
%.businesscorp.com.br

# Multiple domain search
businesscorp.com.br OR businesscorp.com

# Certificate ID search
1234567890
```

**API Usage:**
```bash
# JSON output for automation
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=businesscorp.com.br&output=json" | jq '.[].name_value' | sort -u

# Plain text output
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%.businesscorp.com.br&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u
```

### Automated Certificate Collection Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Certificate Transparency Subdomain Discovery
# Usage: ./cert_discovery.sh domain.com

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <domain>"
    echo "Example: $0 businesscorp.com.br"
    exit 1
fi

DOMAIN="$1"
OUTPUT_FILE="cert_subdomains_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt"

echo "[+] Certificate Transparency Subdomain Discovery"
echo "[+] Target: $DOMAIN"
echo "[+] Output: $OUTPUT_FILE"
echo "================================"

# Query crt.sh API
echo "[+] Querying Certificate Transparency logs..."
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%25.$DOMAIN&output=json" | \
    jq -r '.[].name_value' | \
    sed 's/\*\.//g' | \
    sort -u | \
    grep -v "^$" > "$OUTPUT_FILE"

# Also search for the main domain
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=$DOMAIN&output=json" | \
    jq -r '.[].name_value' | \
    sed 's/\*\.//g' | \
    sort -u | \
    grep -v "^$" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"

# Remove duplicates and clean up
sort -u "$OUTPUT_FILE" -o "$OUTPUT_FILE"

echo "[+] Found $(wc -l < "$OUTPUT_FILE") unique subdomains"
echo "[+] Results saved to: $OUTPUT_FILE"
echo ""
echo "[+] Top 10 discovered subdomains:"
head -10 "$OUTPUT_FILE"

echo ""
echo "================================"
echo "[+] Certificate transparency search complete"
```

### Benefits of Certificate-Based Discovery

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Finds subdomains that might not respond to DNS queries
2. **Historical Data:** Reveals previously used subdomains
3. **Legitimate Sources:** Data comes from official certificate authorities
4. **No Rate Limiting:** Generally unrestricted access to public data
5. **Real-time Updates:** New certificates appear quickly in CT logs

This certificate transparency approach often reveals subdomains that traditional DNS enumeration methods miss, making it an essential technique for comprehensive reconnaissance.
